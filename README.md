Implement a findMatches function that takes a query value and a pre-sorted array of integers that may contain duplicates. It should find and return
 The index of the first instance of the query value in the array, or -1 if the query value does not exist in the array.
 The number of times the query value appears in the array (0 if the query value does not exist in the array).
As an example, if findMatches is called, and  query = 8
 values = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9 } then it should return,
 firstMatchIndex = 9, because values[9] is the first occurrence of 8
 numberOfMatches = 3, because there are three occurrences of 8
